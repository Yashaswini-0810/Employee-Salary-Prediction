# Employee Salary Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using machine learning. It takes user inputs such as years of experience and job rating to estimate a salary value. The model is deployed using a Streamlit web application for ease of access and interaction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed tabular dataset
- Machine Learning model (Linear Regression or KNN)
- Real-time prediction using a web app (Streamlit)
- Model serialization using `joblib`
